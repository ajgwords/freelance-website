    "text": "This page is a brief introduction to the types of work that I have done, what I like to do and what I am interested in. I am a big believer in allowing people to learn and push themselves, and I think the modern workplace often restricts people to a single specialism when they have so much more to offer. The generalist is often undervalued!\nWith that in mind, I often describe myself as an environmental technologist with a career in Earth observation.\n\nAreas I can help with\n\nResearch and solutions around spatial and environmental problems\nProject delivery and project management\nData manmagement and pre-processing of all sorts of data\nData processing using open source tools\nTraining and communication, including workshops, podcasts and videos\nStrategic thinking for business development\n\nBasically, if it’s interesting and I’m available then I’d love to collaborate with you and your team.\n\n\nSpecific skill areas\n\nRemote sensing workflows and processing\nWorkflow architecture design\nOpen source GIS technical skills including spatial data science\nSpatial strategy design and implementation\nScientific communication\nOpen standards advocacy\nHome energy advice and advocacy\n\n\n\nFuture developments\nI am currently interested in returning to undertaking some outdoor work. At the start of my career I undertook land cover and vegetetion surveys as well as supporting hydrology fieldwork and would like to return to a bit more outdoor work. As such I am currently developing skills in drone piloting and data processing, and field survey (e.g. UKHabs).\nMy interests are specifically in plants, vegetation and habitats but I am keen to garner new skills and experience where I can. If you would like an additional reliable person to help with your surveys then do get in touch."

    "text": "Contact\nYou can contact me using the LinkedIn or Mastodon links in the top right corner of this website. Alternatively you can contact me using:\n\n\n\n this email address.\n\n\n\n\nEthics\nI don’t work for organisations or projects that are directly linked to the oil & gas or defence sectors. I don’t fly on environmental grounds. I try to work with teams and on projects that align with my environmental principles and views around a fair society. This does not limit my ability to work, and directs me towards work designed to make a positive difference.\n\n\nLearning\nI am happiest in my work when I am learning new things. My core desire in terms of my career is to know that I have continued to learn throughout. Having an inquisitive mind for topics that interest me makes me a strong researcher. I also understand that whilst needing to work within the parameters of a client’s business it is often beneficial to question the status quo and suggest new ways of looking for solutions.\n\n\nBeing open\nI use open source software almost exclusively on my computers. I preferentially use open data for the majority of my work. If possible, I push for data I generate, or code I write, to be made available under a permissive of copy-left licence. I also prefer to approach project delivery using open and collaborative methods."

    "text": "Geographer for hire: looking to help the planet\nI get stuff done.\nI am a freelance physical geographer with a strong record of delivering practical, high-quality work. My background as an environmental technologist spans a range of applied and academic settings, giving me a broad and adaptable skill set. This ranges from technical computing, to analytical methods, to fieldwork, to teaching and training, to strategic thinking, and much more.\nI love to learn, and as such I bring experience from both commercial and research environments. My approach is analytical, principled and pragmatic, with a focus on realistic solutions to complex environmental challenges. I am trusted to support and deliver complex projects to a high standard, on time and within budget. I place particular value on clear communication and enjoy explaining technical work to a wide range of audiences.\nIn addition to my professional work, I am an active podcaster as a co-host on the Geomob podcast (having previously created and hosted the Scene From Above podcast). I am also a longtime member of the OSGeo:UK committee and am currently in charge of the organisation’s newsletter.\n\n\nAreas of Expertise and Interest\nMy career has focused on Earth observation for land applications. As such much of what drives me, and much of my experience, comes from wanting to understand landscape level patterns and changes. Additionally, when something interests me I usually try to learn as much as I can about the subject: this has led me to understand quite a bit about home energy options and the technology available to help make your home comfortable.\nA short list of my interests includes:\n\nLand cover\nLandscape processes\nHome energy\nData and exploratory coding"
