    "text": "This page is a brief introduction to the types of work that I have done, what I like to do and what I am interested in. I am a big believer in allowing people to learn and push themselves, and think that the modern workplace often restricts people into a single specialism when they have so much more to offer. With that in mind, I often describe myself as a generalist with a career in Earth observation.\n\nsomething\n\nResearch\nProject Delivery\nData Manmagement\nData Processing\nTraining and Communication\nStrategic Thinking\n\nIf it’s interesting and I’m available then I’d love to collaborate with you and your team.\n\n\nSomething else\n\nremote sensing advocacy,\nspatial strategy,\nGIS/RS technical skills,\nscientific communication, open standards advocacy, technical business development, home energy advocacy, renewables, data science."

    "text": "I am a physical geographer and an experienced Earth observation analyst.\n\nEthics\nI don’t work for organisations or projects that are directly linked to the oil & gas or defence sectors. I don’t fly on environmental grounds. I try to work with teams and on projects that align with my environmental principles and views around a fair society. This does not limit my ability twork, and directs me towards work designed to make a positive difference.\n\n\nLearning\nI am happiest in my work when I am learning new things. My core desire in terms of my career is to reach retirement knowing that I have continued to learn throughout. Having an inquisitive mind for topics that interest me makes me a strong researcher. I also understand that whilst needing to work within the parameters of a client’s business it is often beneficial to question the status quo and suggest new ways of looking for solutions.\n\n\nBeing open\nI use open source software almost exclusively on my computers. I preferentially use open data for the majority of my work. If possible, I push for data I generate, or code I write, to be made available under a permissive of copy-left licence. I also prefer to approach project delivery using open and collaborative methods."
