title: "What I do"
---

This page is a brief introduction to the types of work that I have done, what I like to do and what I am interested in. I am a big believer in allowing people to learn and push themselves, and I think the modern workplace often restricts people to a single specialism when they have so much more to offer. The generalist is often undervalued! 

With that in mind, I often describe myself as an environmental technologist with a career in Earth observation.
