# Geographer for hire: looking to help the planet

I am a freelance physical geographer with a strong record of delivering practical, high-quality work. My background as an environmental technologist spans a range of applied and academic settings, giving me a broad and adaptable skill set.

I love to learn, and as such I bring experience from both commercial and research environments. My approach is analytical, principled and pragmatic, with a focus on realistic solutions to complex environmental challenges. I am trusted to support and deliver complex projects to a high standard, on time and within budget. I place particular value on clear communication and enjoy explaining technical work to a wide range of audiences. 

In addition to my professional work, I am an active podcaster. I am also a longtime member of the OSGeo:UK committee and am currently in charge of the organisation's newsletter.
